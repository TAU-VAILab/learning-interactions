## Accompanying Data

See [the data documentation](data) for information on using the accompanying data, including:
* **Waldo and Wenda** benchmark for HHI understanding
* IDs for **imSitu-HHI** subset of the [imSitu](http://imsitu.org/) dataset
* **pHHI** (pseudo-labels indicating HHI) for the [Who's Waldo dataset](https://whoswaldo.github.io)
* **Synthetic caption data** for training summarization model

## Creating Pseudo-Labels

See [the pseudo-labeling documentation](pseudo-labeling) for information on training the summarization model and using it to generate pseudo-labels for the Who's Waldo dataset. Alternatively, you may use pre-computed pseudo-labels (pHHI) â€“ see above.

## Modeling (Training & Pretrained Checkpoint, Inference, Evaluation)

See [the modeling documentation](modeling) for information on training the HHI understanding model (or using a pretrained checkpoint), and running inference and evaluation.
